Phonebook App:

This application is made to run in the command line.  Given a Phonebook (or a dictionary with names associated with various phone numbers) - this will give you five options to interact with that Phonebook.  

The options are as follows:
    1. Look up entry
    2. Set an entry
    3. Delete an entry
    4. List all entries
    5. Quit

If you choose option 5, you will be exited from the Phonebook app. In order to enter, or re-enter the phonebook app, you need to type python oop_phonebook.py from the appropriate location.
